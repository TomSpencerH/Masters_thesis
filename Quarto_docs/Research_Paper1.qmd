## [Analysing the Performance of High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature in Detecting Coastal Upwelling Centres in the Southern Hemisphere - A Benguela Upwelling System Case Study]{.underline}

### Introduction:

The Benguela Upwelling System (BUS) is one of the four major Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) which have been the subject of many studies based on their unique nature of harboring mass assemblages of biodiversity and abundance of marine organisms. These coastal systems account for an overwhelming \~20% of fish stock around the globe despite their combined relatively small spatial extents (\<3% of the world's ocean mass) (Ryther, 1969; Cushin, 1971; Pauly & Christensen, 1995; Bindoff et al., 2019; Bonino et al., 2019; Bograd et al., 2023). The process which makes these upwelling systems, including the BUS, so environmentally and economically important is mainly the oceanographic process of coastal upwelling. Coastal upwelling is driven by equatorward trade-winds, which in some parts of the EBUS's (mainly the poleward portion) only experience these winds in Summer months, which brings about strong inter-annual and seasonal differences in upwelling regions along these coastlines. Major studies of upwelling in the EBUS's have widely used the response variable of sea surface temperature (SST) to study the spatial patterns, as wind-driven upwelling results in colder sea surface temperatures. SST datasets have proven to be an effective variable to investigate upwelling as there is an extensive record of remotely sensed SST datasets made publicly available through online repositories.

Due to the unforgiving landscape of the ocean for in-situ data collection, the prevailing data being used in the field of oceanography are remotely sensed satellite data, made available through online repositories. However, there are numerous considerations to be made when dealing with this data, in terms of the strengths and weaknesses the data will pose for your research questions. Satellite sensors are limited in their capabilities to defer the many disturbances one can expect when considering the largely variable environment of the ocean. There are two types of sensors on-board satellites. There are passive microwave sensors, which are able to penetrate cloud cover and minimise the amplitude of other such potential interferences. However, these sensors allow only for low resolution imagery (25 - 50 km), and their accuracy has been seen to decrease near coastlines due to land contamination and radio frequency interference. Then there are thermal infrared sensors, which are strongly impacted by atmospheric interferences, such as cloud cover. However, these sensors allow for a much higher image resolution (\~1 km). Therefore, MW sensors have missing data along the coastal band, whilst IR sensors have missing data according to cloud cover and other aerosol interference. The incomplete data brought about by the two types of sensors, as well as the lack of satellite data collected at high resolutions at global scale over long time periods has led to the development of different merging and interpolation techniques to allow for more complete data. This data are known as Level 4 (L4) processed data, and is categorized as near real time, high resolution data. The most well documented of this type of data are the many different SST data products found in multiple online repositories that are accessible by the public.

A common issue with the use of Level 4 data in many areas, is the over-reliance on interpolation schemes due to the lack of input of actual in-situ measurements in specific areas. This is a known problem for the Southern Hemisphere, as the scientific infrastructure in this hemisphere is not as well established in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, this study aims to identify the performance of the highest resolution SST data products available for the BUS, by means of investigating the ability or lack there of, of these products to identify the known spatial and seasonal patterns that take place along the coastline of the BUS.

Numerous methodologies have been implemented in previous EBUS studies to identify spatial and temporal patterns/trends in upwelling driver and response variables. The general techniques come in the form of different upwelling indices where upwelling events can be studied across space and time in order to understand the inter-annual variability of coastal upwelling and to predict the trajectory it is on under the threat of anthropogenic change.

[**Hypothesis:**]{.underline}

The different high resolution SST data products will perform differently in identifying the mesoscale spatial and seasonal patterns due to their different sensors and interpolation techniques -\> Datasets with little to no in-situ measurements will have the poorest performance

Shelf width has influence on upwelling seen by SST gradient along differing widths of the continental shelf - narrow shelf width -\> increased SST gradient.

The focus region of this study is the Benguela Upwelling System (BUS)(Fig.1), which is one of the most productive EBUS's (Jarre et al., 2015; Kainge et al., 2020) with its coastline extending latitudinally from the Angola-Benguela front (\~17°S) to Cape Agulhas (35°S), as well as longitudinally from the coastline to the continental shelf boundary which can reach up to 250 km (Bordbar et al., 2021). The BUS consists of two subsystems divided by the intense perennial upwelling cell of Luderitz (26° - 27°S). These two subsystems include the; sBUS characterised by seasonal upwelling which occurs in the austral summer months (December, January and February), and nBUS which experiences year-long perennial upwelling driven by the cross-shore sea level pressure gradient between the South Atlantic Anticyclone (SAA) and the Angola-Kalahari low pressure system (Bakun, 1996; Sakko, 1998; Feistel et al., 2003). The latitudinal migration of the SAA has shown to influence upwelling in both the nBUS and sBUS (Jarre et al., 2015; Lamont et al., 2018). Important upwelling cells have been previously identified in the areas located at; Cape Frio (19°S), Walvis Bay (23°S), Luderitz (25° - 26°S), Namaqua (30°S), Cape Columbine (32°S) and Cape Town (34°S) with two major embayments located at Walvis Bay (23°S) and St Helena Bay (32°S) (Shannon, 1985; Hutchings et al., 2009)

[**Data Products:**]{.underline}

The SST datasets used for this analysis are all near real-time, daily Level 4 (L4) processed data that has undergone optimal interpolation, all from the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST). These data products have the highest resolutions found for the Benguela region with three datasets having a \~5 km resolution (OSTIA, OSPO and DMI_OI) and one having a \~1km resolution (MUR). Most of the studies involving coastal upwelling in the EBUS's contain low resolution, weekly or monthly averaged SST data, whilst upwelling occurs at the mesoscale over spurious short periods at different regional scales. That is why it is important to investigate the capability of the different high resolution, daily data available for these regions. The observations from these products are based off both daytime and nighttime observations with a global spatial extent and differing temporal ranges extending from 06/2002 - present. It was important that a large temporal range was chosen in order to reduce the noise of anomalous events such as Benguela Ninos and Ninas etc.

[**SST Gradient:**]{.underline}

-   Identifying inter-annual and seasonal variability between the different SST products and their ability to identify the known spatial patterns and trends to occur in the BUS based off previous research done on upwelling in the area.

-   To do this we used shore-normal transects along the spatial extent of the BUS coastline extending offshore to the border of the continental shelf (\~200 km). These transects were constructed along the coastline of the study site using the trasects function from the coastR package. This function allows you to calculate the resulting angle from a coastal point against true North. By using the spread function, you can appropriately adjust the angle of the transect to accommodate for mesoscale features that would otherwise disrupt the distribution of transects in coastal studies, or significantly reduce the spatial extent of the study.

-   This method considers the orientation of the coast, and the mesoscale features that factor in to the topographic influence on upwelling such as; embayments, bottom slope topography, shelf width and so on. This method is in opposition to the previous ways SST gradient historically was calculated, which was mainly through a two point cross-shore transect extending from a point on the coast to a fixed distance/s offshore, where the SST difference between the coastal and offshore points were averaged at the same latitude to represent the SST gradient (Mittelstaedt, 1991; Van Camp et al.,1991; Nykjaer and Van Camp, 1994; Santos et al., 2005; Lathurilère et al., 2008; Marcello et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2012; Vasquez-Cuervo et al., 2013; Benazzouz et al., 2014; Vasquez-Cuervo et al., 2017; Naulita et al., 2020). This cross-shore method using various different satellite-based approaches does not effectively consider the various mesoscale coastal features. Therefore, these studies would select an area with a relatively uniform coastal orientation and set up a select number of these two point cross-shore transects. The shore-normal method allows for transects to be constructed along the entire study area's coastline.

-   Another alteration of the method used in this study is the calculating of the SST~gradient~ using linear regression of SST over multiple points on each transect over time. As opposed to calculating SST~gradient~ as ∆SST = SST~coast~ - SST~ocean~ averaged at all coastal and oceanic locations.

    To calculate a simple linear regression line you would use the equation:

$$
\bar{y} = a + b \bar{x}
$$

where

$$
b = \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}}{\sum{(x_i - x)^2}}
$$

b is the slope value of the linear regression equation, and is to be used as the SST~gradient~ .

-   In order to investigate the inter-annual and seasonal upwelling patterns, the data was grouped into each individual transect over each month where the broom package in R was used to perform a linear regression on SST as a function of distance from the coast over the 5 year period.
