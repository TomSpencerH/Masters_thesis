## [Identification of Upwelling Centres in the Benguela Upwelling System using a High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature Data Approach]{.underline}

### Introduction:

The Benguela Upwelling System (BUS) is one of the four major Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) which have been the subject of many studies based on their unique nature of harboring mass assemblages of biodiversity and abundance of marine organisms. These coastal systems account for an overwhelming \~20% of fish stock around the globe despite their combined relatively small spatial extents (\<3% of the world's ocean mass) (Ryther, 1969; Cushin, 1971; Pauly & Christensen, 1995; Bindoff et al., 2019; Bonino et al., 2019; Bograd et al., 2023). Due to the environmental and economic importance of these systems, multiple studies have been conducted in these regions to better understand what makes these areas so suitable for the process of upwelling. The major driving force of this 3D ocean circulation is both the alongshore wind stress, brought about by equatorward wind stress, and cross-shore wind gradient influenced by atmospheric pressure systems and resulting wind stress curl (Bakun & Nelson, 1991; Marchesiello et al., 2003; Fennel & Lass, 2007; Albert et al., 2010; Garcia-Reyes et al., 2015; Gill, 2016; Bonino et al., 2019). These driving forces interact with the environmental topographies present in these systems, which ultimately influence the ocean dynamics involved in coastal upwelling, causing certain areas to have more intense upwelling than others. These environmental factors include; shelf width and depth; coastline orientation; capes and embayments; riverine input to coastal waters (Mackas et al., 2006; Marchesiello & Estrade, 2010; Dunn et al., 2018). The interaction between these driving variables and environmental factors result in the response variable of changing sea surface temperature (SST).

Previous studies of identifying upwelling centers in the EBUS's have used the methods of simply identifying where temperatures seem to be coldest in older papers (Shannon, 1985). In newer papers, various clustering methods using SST satellite imagery and upwelling metrics through different upwelling indices have been used to try and identify upwelling centers. However, none of the above mentioned methods lend themselves to finer scale determination on why certain areas along the coast may be more susceptible to upwelling than other areas on the coast. These studies do not take into account the distinction between coastal waters and open ocean where temperature profiles differ significantly as a function of topography. This paper looks at a high resolution, shore-normal transect approach which accounts for various coastal features and their potential influence on upwelling dynamics along the continental shelf in areas where upwelling is seen to be most intense. This approach allows for simple linear regressions to be ran along the transects at a high resolution, which provides a framework for future studies to use this methodology for identifying both spatial and temporal oceanographic trends along coastal regions around the globe

Major studies of upwelling in the EBUS's have widely used remotely sensed satellite data in order to identify the spatial patterns of where upwelling is most intense along these regions of coast. Satellite imagery is emerging in importance in oceanographic studies because of the unforgiving landscape of the ocean for in-situ data collection. SST is a major focus on studying upwelling due to cooling SST being a response variable to coastal upwelling and the accompanying extensive record of SST data products on various online repositories accessible to public. However, there are numerous considerations to be made when dealing with satellite data, in terms of the strengths and weaknesses the data will pose for your research questions. Satellite sensors are limited in their capabilities to defer the many disturbances one can expect when considering the largely variable environment of the ocean. There are two types of sensors on-board satellites. There are passive microwave sensors, which are able to penetrate cloud cover and minimise the amplitude of other such potential interferences. However, these sensors allow only for low resolution imagery (25 - 50 km), and their accuracy has been seen to decrease near coastlines due to land contamination and radio frequency interference. Then there are thermal infrared (IR) sensors, which are strongly impacted by atmospheric interferences, such as cloud cover. However, these sensors allow for a much higher image resolution (\~1 km). Therefore, MW sensors have missing data along the coastal band, whilst IR sensors have missing data according to cloud cover and other aerosol interference. The incomplete data brought about by the two types of sensors, as well as the lack of satellite data collected at high resolutions at global scale over long time periods has led to the development of different merging and interpolation techniques to allow for more complete data. These data are known as Level 4 (L4) processed data, and is categorized as near real time, high resolution data. An emerging problem in The Southern Hemisphere is the over-reliance on interpolation schemes with minimal to no in-situ measurements into these L4 data products. Therefore, it is of great importance to measure the performance of these data products in areas like the BUS for future studies.

In terms of upwelling studies conducted in the EBUS's, it is known that there is very little coinciding SST spatial trends due to the vast array of differing data products and their varying spatial and temporal ranges. Previous approaches using SST data have also struggled to discern between inter-annual to multi-decadal variability on a regional scale. Therefore, it is important to look into the details of different SST data products and how these details align with your research purpose i.e high spatial resolution to identify mesoscale features influence on upwelling intensity.

[**Hypothesis:**]{.underline}

The different high resolution SST data products will perform differently in identifying the mesoscale spatial and seasonal patterns due to their different sensors and interpolation techniques -\> Datasets with little to no in-situ measurements will have the poorest performance

Shelf width has influence on upwelling seen by SST gradient along differing widths of the continental shelf - narrow shelf width -\> increased SST gradient.

The focus region of this study is the Benguela Upwelling System (BUS)(Fig.1), which is one of the most productive EBUS's (Jarre et al., 2015; Kainge et al., 2020) with its coastline extending latitudinally from the Angola-Benguela front (\~17°S) to Cape Agulhas (35°S), as well as longitudinally from the coastline to the continental shelf boundary which can reach up to 200 km (Bordbar et al., 2021). The BUS consists of two subsystems divided by the intense perennial upwelling cell of Luderitz (26° - 27°S). These two subsystems include the; sBUS characterised by seasonal upwelling which occurs in the austral summer months (December, January and February), and nBUS which experiences year-long perennial upwelling driven by the cross-shore sea level pressure gradient between the South Atlantic Anticyclone (SAA) and the Angola-Kalahari low pressure system (Bakun, 1996; Sakko, 1998; Feistel et al., 2003).

There aren't many studies on upwelling centres in the BUS, with most recent upwelling studies making use of the previously defined upwelling cells determined by older papers (\<2003) from Shannon (1985), Lutjeharms & Meeuwis (1987) and Demarcq et al. (2003). These defined cells include; Cape Frio (19°S), Walvis Bay (23°S), Luderitz (25° - 26°S), Namaqua (30°S), Cape Columbine (32°S) and Cape Town (34°S). Outdated SST imagery was used to identify these upwelling cells through inter-annual, monthly and season analyses. It is important to update or even confirm these upwelling areas using modern data and technique

[**Data Products:**]{.underline}

The SST datasets used for this analysis are all near real-time, daily Level 4 (L4) processed data that has undergone optimal interpolation, all from the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST). These data products include; Multiscale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR), The Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Ice Analysis (OSTIA), The Geo-Polar Blended Sea Surface Temperature (OSPO) and Global Foundation Sea Surface Temperature Analysis (DMI_OI) - see Table 1. These data products have the highest resolutions found for the Benguela region, with three datasets having a \~5 km resolution (OSTIA, OSPO and DMI_OI) and one having a \~1km resolution (MUR). Most of the studies involving coastal upwelling in the EBUS's contain low resolution, weekly or monthly averaged SST data, whilst upwelling occurs at the mesoscale over spurious short periods at different regional scales. That is why it is important to investigate the capability of the different high resolution, daily data available for these regions. The observations from these products are based off both daytime and nighttime observations with a global spatial extent and differing temporal ranges extending from June 2002 - present. It was important that a large temporal range was chosen in order to reduce the noise of anomalous events such as Benguela Ninos and Ninas. For this study, the daily data were averaged according to each individual month spanning a 5-year period from January 2017 to December 2021.

[**SST Gradient:**]{.underline}

-   Previous studies have used various clustering methods with SST satellite images in determining upwelling centers along the EBUS's. This study makes use of calculated SST gradients along shore-normal transects, suited for high resolution data products, fitted along the entire coastline of the study region (17ºS to 35ºS) and extending offshore to the border of the continental shelf (\~200km). These transects were constructed along the coastline using the transects function from the coastR package. This function allows you to calculate the resulting angle from a coastal point against true North. By using the spread function, you can appropriately adjust the angle of the transect to accommodate for mesoscale features that would otherwise disrupt the distribution of transects in coastal studies, or significantly reduce the spatial extent of the study.

-   The reasoning behind this approach is the consideration of coastal features associated with driving or inhibiting upwelling that have not been looked at, at finer resolutions. The use of coarser resolution data products tends to overlook major mesoscale features, thus not allowing for the proper comprehension of some of the topographic influences these features have on why certain areas are more susceptible to the phenomena of upwelling. The method of using high resolution data products in conjunction with shore-normal transects, provide a framework/foundation for which can be applied to future studies that want to look at the effects of environmental factors such as; embayments, bottom slope, shelf width etc., on the various metrics of upwelling.

-   In previous papers, the calculation of SST gradient was used as a method of calculating upwelling intensity, mainly done through constructing a two point cross-shore transect extending from a point on the coast to a fixed distance/s offshore, where the SST difference between the coastal and offshore points were averaged at the coastal and oceanic locations to represent the SST gradient. Another method for Level 3 data with gaps, was using a centred finite difference approach which resulted in a magnitude of a SST gradient at given longitude and latitudes (Mittelstaedt, 1991; Van Camp et al.,1991; Nykjaer and Van Camp, 1994; Santos et al., 2005; Lathurilère et al., 2008; Marcello et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2012; Vasquez-Cuervo et al., 2013; Benazzouz et al., 2014; Vasquez-Cuervo et al., 2017; Naulita et al., 2020). This cross-shore method using various different satellite-based approaches does not cater effectively to the various mesoscale coastal features that influence upwelling dynamics across the continental shelf.

    *(Left) Shore-normal transects along the BUS on the continental shelf. (Right) Cross-shore transects along the BUS running across the continental shelf (blue contours)*

-   The previous calculation of SST~gradient~ in past papers were oversimplified (∆SST = SST~Ocean~ -SST~coastal~) and lended themselves to smoothing effects due to the nature of using coarse resolution data products that are simply incapable of accounting for mesoscale coastal features. In this paper we conduct linear regressions (Eq.1) along each individual transect where the multiple data points along the transect are averaged over the 5 year time period for each month.

    To calculate a simple linear regression line you would use the equation:

$$
\bar{y} = a + b \bar{x}
$$

where

$$
b = \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}}{\sum{(x_i - x)^2}}
$$

b is the slope value of the linear regression equation, and is to be used as the SST~gradient~ .

-   In order to investigate the inter-annual and seasonal upwelling patterns, the data was grouped into each individual transect over each month where the broom package in R was used to perform a linear regression on SST as a function of distance from the coast over the 5 year period.
